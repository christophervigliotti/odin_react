works!  with added bonus test.  this blows selenium out of the water, yo.

    the playwright.config.ts file does not appear to be used at all when I 
    execute command npx playwright test --headed (when I am in the 'src' folder).  

    It does work when I execute the command from this project's root dir.  

    Very interesting!
